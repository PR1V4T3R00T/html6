		<h3>Plot</h3>
		<p><strong>Doom</strong> is set in a research facility on Mars owned by the Union Aerospace Corporation. The director of the facility is Samuel Hayden, whose mind now inhabits an android body after he lost his original one to brain cancer. The researchers attempted to draw energy from Hell in order to solve an energy crisis on Earth. This was done with the Argent Tower, which not only siphons energy from Hell, but allows travel to and from there. Hayden has already led multiple expeditions into Hell, bringing back captive demons and artifacts for study. One artifact was a sarcophagus containing the <strong><i>Doom Slayer</i></strong>, whom the demons imprisoned after his rampage through Hell.</p>
		<p>The facility has been invaded by demons after one of its scientists, Olivia Pierce, made a pact with them and opened a portal to Hell. In desperation, Samuel Hayden releases the Doom Slayer from his sarcophagus to repel the demonic invasion and close the portal. The Doom Slayer fights his way through the overrun facility and makes several excursions into Hell. He steals a magical blade called "the Crucible", which he then uses to destroy the portal's power source. He shortly comes across Pierce, who transforms into the monstrous Spider Mastermind, and kills her. Upon the Doom Slayer's return to Mars, Hayden confiscates the Crucible, which he plans to use in his research. Despite all that has happened, Earth is too desperate for energy to give up. To prevent the Doom Slayer from interfering, Hayden teleports him to an undisclosed location, saying that they will meet again.</p>
